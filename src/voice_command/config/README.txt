To use CMU Sphinx for speech recognition, you must create a dictionary of terms you'd like to recognize.  This is simply a text file containing
all phrases you'd like to use.  Once you have that file, you need to create the .dict and .lm files that CMU Sphinx uses.  This is an automated
process handled by the CMU Sphinx team, you can upload your text file here : http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html
